IMVU-specific SCons notes:

This directory contains a local installation of SCons, a utility for building
software (like make, ant, CMake, etc.).

This installation of SCons is used to build IMVUJS, as well as some other
projects that consume IMVUJS, like the website and Northstar projects.  (The
IMVU client also uses SCons, but it has its own installation in /Stable/Ext .)

We have made local changes to this SCons installation to allow us to generate
Visual Studio projects for Northstar.

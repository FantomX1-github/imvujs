# Web Deployment

imvujs's build process packages it into: imvu.js and imvu.min.js.

imvu.js is the debug build and imvu.min.js is minified with Closure
Compiler.  Include it with a script tag before anything else.  If
you'd like to use a different version of jQuery or Backbone, include
them after imvujs.

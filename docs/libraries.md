# imvujs libraries

imvujs includes several common libraries so that they can be combined
and deployed as a single JavaScript file.

They are:

* [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)
* [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [js-uri](http://code.google.com/p/js-uri/)

Together, Underscore and Backbone only contribute about 12 KB of
gzipped JavaScript to imvujs.

jQuery is larger at about 33 KB, but it's common enough to include
in the single minified JavaScript file.
